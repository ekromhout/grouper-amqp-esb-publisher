# Grouper ESB AMQP Publisher Username Password Support

This is a minor tweak to Unicon's good work in the project.

*  https://github.com/Unicon/grouper-amqp-esb-publisher/

Adding username password support via two additional properties.
I did this to remove a dependency on the RabbitMQ "Guest" user
being available, which is not allowed by default other than localhost.
Please refer to Unicon's repository above for information on 
other properties and general information on the project.

# These properties add username password support

changeLog.consumer.esbAmqp.username
changeLog.consumer.esbAmqp.password

#For example

changeLog.consumer.esbAmqp.username = midpoint
changeLog.consumer.esbAmqp.password = 5ecr3t
